# 📊 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (Excel BI Project)

A complete Excel-based Business Intelligence Dashboard built to analyze road accident patterns, severity, and risk factors using detailed accident records. This project transforms raw data into actionable insights that can help traffic authorities, researchers, and data analysts understand the causes behind accidents and plan safety interventions.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Road accidents are a critical public safety issue causing thousands of deaths, injuries, and economic losses every year. However, accident data is often scattered across multiple fields and does not provide immediate clarity to policy makers.

This project solves that problem by building a **comprehensive, interactive dashboard** that answers:

- When do most accidents occur?
- Which road types and surfaces are most dangerous?
- What environmental conditions influence accident severity?
- How many casualties occur and at what severity levels?
- What patterns can help reduce road accidents?

The dashboard provides data-driven insights for efficient decision-making in traffic safety and enforcement planning.
